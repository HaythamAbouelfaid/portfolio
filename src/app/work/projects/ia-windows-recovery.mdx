## Overview

This project documents a real-world IT recovery scenario where a Windows 10 desktop was compromised by a suspected cyberattack and rendered unbootable with **Error 1962: No Operating System Found**. The system was effectively “dead on arrival,” unable to load the OS or detect the boot drive.

I approached the problem systematically:

1. **Diagnosed BIOS state:** Discovered the boot drive missing.  
2. **Reconfigured firmware:** Adjusted UEFI/Legacy boot order and CSM settings.  
3. **Attempted repair:** Ran Windows built-in tools (`DISM`, `SFC`) for OS recovery.  
4. **Escalated response:** When repair failed, created a bootable USB installer.  
5. **Performed clean install:** Reinstalled Windows 10, restored functionality, verified stability.  

**Why this matters:** IT professionals frequently encounter endpoint failures caused by malware, corruption, or misconfigurations. This project demonstrates hands-on **BIOS troubleshooting, OS recovery, and escalation to clean reinstalls**—critical Tier 1–2 IT support and cybersecurity response skills.

## Key Features

- **BIOS investigation:**  
  - Accessed BIOS **Main** and **Devices** tabs to confirm hardware presence.  
  - Startup tab revealed incorrect boot mode.  
  - Reconfigured **UEFI/CSM settings** and boot order.

- **Windows Recovery Environment:**  
  - Used advanced boot options to reach **WinRE**.  
  - Attempted startup repair, Safe Mode, and advanced recovery options.

- **Command-line diagnostics:**  
  - Executed **System File Checker (SFC):**  
    ```bash
    sfc /scannow
    ```
  - Attempted **Deployment Imaging Servicing and Management (DISM):**  
    ```bash
    DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
    ```
  - Checked Windows Modules Installer service in **Services.msc**.

- **OS Reinstallation via Bootable Media:**  
  - Created bootable USB with **Windows Media Creation Tool**.  
  - Wiped corrupted partitions and reinstalled Windows 10 cleanly.  
  - Verified successful boot into the restored login screen.

## Technologies Used

- **Firmware & OS:** BIOS/UEFI configuration, Windows 10, CSM boot.  
- **Recovery Tools:** Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE), Startup Settings.  
- **Command-Line Utilities:** `DISM`, `SFC`, `services.msc`.  
- **Boot Media:** Windows Media Creation Tool, USB bootloader.  
- **Security Context:** Malware suspicion, incident response mindset.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **BIOS detection issues:** Initially the boot drive was not visible; required toggling UEFI/Legacy support.  
- **Windows repair failures:** `DISM` and `SFC` could not restore integrity, forcing escalation.  
- **Recovery options missing:** Default **Reset this PC** option was absent, highlighting the need for external media.  
- **Incident context:** Root cause traced to suspected malware that damaged boot records.  

**Key takeaway:** In endpoint recovery, layered troubleshooting is critical:  
- **Step 1:** Attempt least invasive fixes (BIOS, Safe Mode, DISM/SFC).  
- **Step 2:** Escalate to reinstall if unrecoverable.  
- **Step 3:** Validate system stability and re-enforce basic cyber hygiene.

## Outcome

- **System recovery:** Fully restored functionality via Windows 10 reinstall.  
- **Skills demonstrated:** BIOS troubleshooting, WinRE usage, DISM/SFC commands, clean OS installation.  
- **Recruiter value:** This project simulates **Tier 1–2 IT support, helpdesk escalation, and cyber incident response**—diagnosing a compromised system, executing repairs, and knowing when to escalate to reinstall.  
- **Next steps:**  
  - Add post-incident hardening (AV install, patching, firewall).  
  - Automate bootable USB creation with scripted tools.  
  - Document recovery SOPs for faster future response.
