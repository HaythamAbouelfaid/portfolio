## Overview

I am building **IntelliPath AI**, a web platform designed to help users make consistent progress across any area of life—career, finance, technical skills, or personal growth.  

The app combines **AI-powered chat**, **YouTube transcript analysis**, and **structured note generation** to provide clear, actionable takeaways from video learning content. Users can save content, search past work, and organize videos/notes into categorized folders.  

**Why this matters:** The internet has an abundance of self-improvement and technical learning resources, but it’s overwhelming and time-consuming to filter through. IntelliPath AI creates a **personalized productivity system** that converts passive watching into active knowledge retention and structured learning.

## Key Features

- **Transcript Analysis & Summarization**  
  - Integrated AI models to parse YouTube transcripts (with fallback to external STT if disabled).  
  - Automatically generate structured notes: key points, practical applications, and action steps.  
  - Notes adapt to user-defined goals (e.g., “I want to master the 48 Laws of Power”).  

- **AI Assistant Chatbox**  
  - Users can ask questions about video content or their notes.  
  - AI provides context-aware answers, explanations, and examples.  
  - Chat history is persistent and searchable.

- **Sidebar Navigation (ChatGPT-style)**  
  - Recent conversations automatically titled by keyword + prompt.  
  - Options to rename, share, or delete conversations.  
  - Saved folders auto-organize by subject/goal; users can also create custom folders.  
  - Popup window for folder contents with search and scrolling support.

- **Monetization & Plans**  
  - Free plan with limited history/summaries.  
  - Premium plan (Stripe integration) with 14-day trial, unlimited summaries, advanced notes, and folder management.  

- **Cloud Storage Integration**  
  - Supabase database and storage ensure persistence of conversations, notes, and saved videos.  
  - OAuth 2.0 (Google, LinkedIn, Apple) for account authentication.  

- **Automated Categorization**  
  - Saved content is auto-tagged by theme and learning goal.  
  - Enhances search and helps build thematic knowledge libraries.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, lucide-react icons.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Node.js API routes for handling video/transcripts.  
- **AI Models:** OpenAI API (chat + summarization), Whisper/AssemblyAI for transcript fallback.  
- **Database & Auth:** Supabase (Postgres, storage, OAuth 2.0).  
- **Payments:** Stripe (plans, billing portal, free trial).  
- **Cloud:** Vercel/Tempo for hosting and CI/CD integration.  
- **Integrations:** YouTube Data API for metadata, transcript parsing libraries.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Transcript reliability:** YouTube’s transcript API often failed when captions were disabled. To address this, I implemented a **fallback transcription system** (Whisper/AssemblyAI) to ensure coverage for any video.  
- **State persistence:** Initially, refreshing reset progress. I redesigned data flows with Supabase to **persist user history, folders, and settings** across sessions.  
- **AI answer quality:** Early versions returned generic responses. By refining system prompts and structuring assistant behavior, I enabled **flexible Q&A** that supports productivity, context recall, and follow-up learning.  
- **Monetization flow:** Integrated Stripe plans (free + premium trial), ensuring **subscription logic works across account states**.  
- **UI/UX:** Modeled the sidebar experience after ChatGPT for familiarity, while adding custom features like folder popups and automatic categorization.

**Takeaway:** This project deepened my skills in **full-stack development, AI integration, and SaaS product design**. It’s teaching me to handle not just technical challenges but also **user experience design, persistence, and monetization**—skills critical for building real-world IT/AI platforms.

## Outcome

- **Status:** *In Progress*  
- **Deliverables so far:**  
  - Functional transcript summarization + note generation pipeline.  
  - AI assistant chat with context awareness.  
  - Sidebar with persistent history and folders.  
  - Stripe-based subscription plans and Supabase persistence.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Expand transcript fallback pipeline for edge cases.  
- Add profile customization (pfp, settings, account switching).  
- Improve note quality with timestamped key-point extraction.  
- Beta test with real users for feedback.
