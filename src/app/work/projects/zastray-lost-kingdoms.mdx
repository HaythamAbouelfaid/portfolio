## Overview

**Astray: Lost Kingdoms** is a 16-bit/pixel art RPG currently in development, built with **Python and Pygame**. The project demonstrates **object-oriented programming**, event-driven logic, and iterative development practices applied to a creative, story-driven software system.  

The game begins with a **cutscene-driven intro** (player at home, items sucked into a magical portal) that transitions seamlessly into gameplay where the player falls through the sky, learns movement controls, and begins their adventure in a fantasy world.  

This project is designed not only as a **game**, but also as a way to simulate **real-world software engineering processes**: asset integration, debugging, feature iteration, and version control.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Menus & UI**  
  - Main menu with animated logo, music, and button transitions.  
  - In-game UI includes **health, mana, experience, hunger bars**, inventory slots, and gold counter.  
  - UI expands dynamically as the player progresses (map, quest log, tips).  

- **Cutscenes & Transitions**  
  - Intro cutscene coded in Pygame (not pre-rendered), with item physics, portal effects, and screen shake.  
  - Smooth right-to-left wipe transition from cutscene â†’ gameplay.  
  - Black cinematic bars (`black_bars.png`) for immersion.  

- **Object-Oriented Game Logic**  
  - Classes for **Player, Items, UI elements, and Game States**.  
  - Event-driven input handling for **WASD movement, item pickup, and inventory updates**.  
  - Modular design enables scalability for quest systems and combat mechanics.  

- **Custom Pixel Art Assets**  
  - Created player sprite, item icons (bread, apple, pan), and living room background (960x640).  
  - Assets integrated with transparency and scaling for retro-style visuals.  
  - Plan to expand asset library for environments, NPCs, and enemies.  

- **Planned Quest & Progression Systems**  
  - Story-driven questline with branching dialogue and objectives.  
  - Combat mechanics with health/mana costs and enemy AI.  
  - Player progression through XP, gold, and item crafting.

## Technologies Used

- **Core Engine:** Python, Pygame  
- **Game Design & Assets:** Aseprite/Piskel (pixel art), Photoshop for UI polish  
- **Programming Concepts:**  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance)  
  - Event-driven input handling  
  - Real-time rendering and animation loops  
- **Development Practices:**  
  - Git/GitHub for version control  
  - Iterative prototyping (feature-by-feature builds)  
  - Debugging with logging and frame-by-frame testing  

**Sample: Player movement logic in Pygame**

```python
def handle_game_input(self):
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_w]:
        self.y -= self.speed
    if keys[pygame.K_s]:
        self.y += self.speed
    if keys[pygame.K_a]:
        self.x -= self.speed
    if keys[pygame.K_d]:
        self.x += self.speed
