## The Problem

A friend’s PC was left completely unbootable — stuck on **“Error 1962: No Operating System Found”** after a suspected virus wiped critical boot data.  
Instead of declaring it a loss, I treated this as a real-world IT troubleshooting exercise.

## The Process

Here’s how I worked through the recovery:

1. **BIOS/UEFI Inspection**  
   - Accessed BIOS to confirm drives were detected.  
   - Reviewed and adjusted **Boot Order, UEFI/Legacy mode, and CSM** settings.  

2. **System File Checks**  
   - Booted into recovery tools.  
   - Used **Command Prompt** to run diagnostics.  
   - Tried `sfc /scannow` and `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth` to verify integrity.  

3. **Service & Hardware Verification**  
   - Cross-checked system info and hardware status.  
   - Confirmed the issue wasn’t hardware failure but a corrupted OS boot sector.  

4. **Reinstallation**  
   - Created a bootable USB with Windows 10.  
   - Performed a **clean install** to fully restore system functionality.

## Key Challenges

- **No Salvage Path**: Once it was clear the OS was beyond repair, I had to pivot from recovery to reinstall.  
- **BIOS Confusion**: Default boot configs didn’t match the new USB media — required careful reordering.  
- **Patience in Testing**: Multiple repair commands and reboots were necessary to rule out partial fixes.

## What I Learned

- **Structured Troubleshooting Works**: Moving step by step (BIOS → repair tools → reinstall) prevents guesswork.  
- **Not Every System Can Be Repaired**: Sometimes the clean install is the most efficient, reliable fix.  
- **Communicating With Non-Technical Users**: I had to explain to my friend why a reinstall was necessary, which is a key IT support skill.

## Outcome

From a system that showed nothing but **Error 1962**, I restored the PC to a fully working state.  
This wasn’t just about fixing one computer — it reinforced the fundamentals of:  

- BIOS/UEFI configuration  
- System file checks and command-line tools  
- Recovery planning and fallback strategies

## Takeaway

This project taught me that real-world IT work isn’t always glamorous SOC dashboards — sometimes it’s methodical break/fix work that keeps systems alive.  
Both matter equally in an IT career, and this gave me confidence handling boot-level failures in the field.
