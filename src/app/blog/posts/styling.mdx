## Why Certifications Matter

Certifications give me **structured learning, proof of knowledge, and discipline** in the IT & cybersecurity field.  
Unlike projects where I set my own scope, certifications require me to **complete modules, labs, and assessments under structured guidance**, which pushed me to stay consistent.  

Each certification below took dedicated time and effort â€” often balancing my **college coursework, labs, and self-study** â€” but the payoff has been huge: Iâ€™m more confident, more employable, and better prepared for my future career.

- **Effort:** ~6 months of structured modules and labs on Coursera, 5 full courses.  
- **Skills Gained:** Troubleshooting (hardware & software), networking, Windows & Linux administration, cybersecurity fundamentals, and PowerShell scripting.  
- **What I Did:**  
  - Built virtual labs to simulate real IT support tickets.  
  - Practiced account management, system administration, and network troubleshooting.  
  - Performed exercises in **encryption, virtualization, and disaster recovery**.  
- **Application:** This certificate gave me the foundation for projects like the **Windows Recovery (Error 1962)** rebuild and **Active Directory SIEM lab**, where I used the troubleshooting mindset I practiced in the cert.

- **Effort:** Weeks of coursework with labs on Python and AI tools.  
- **Skills Gained:** AI concepts, machine learning principles, ethical considerations, Python programming for AI.  
- **What I Did:**  
  - Completed exercises where I wrote Python code to demonstrate **basic AI applications**.  
  - Explored real-world use cases of AI in productivity and problem solving.  
  - Learned ethical challenges in AI adoption (bias, transparency, privacy).  
- **Application:** Inspired my ongoing project **IntelliPath AI**, where I use AI models to summarize YouTube transcripts into structured notes. This certification gave me the confidence to **merge AI concepts with real coding projects**.

- **Effort:** Several weeks of structured study, quizzes, and applied learning.  
- **Skills Gained:** Identity & access management (IAM), threat detection, network security, and data protection.  
- **What I Did:**  
  - Studied case-based security scenarios, identifying vulnerabilities and applying mitigations.  
  - Gained hands-on with principles of **threat modeling, risk analysis, and system hardening**.  
  - Learned how enterprises structure **IAM policies and defense-in-depth** strategies.  
- **Application:** Directly improved my **SOC honeypot (Sentinel)** and **Splunk + SOAR lab**, where I had to think like an analyst to set up alerts, permissions, and log monitoring. It also prepared me to talk security fundamentals in interviews.

## In Progress: Google Cybersecurity Certificate ðŸš§

- **Effort So Far:** Ongoing self-paced study with labs in Linux, SIEM, and SOC operations.  
- **Skills Building:**  
  - Log analysis and incident response.  
  - Network defense and intrusion detection.  
  - Cloud security concepts and SOC workflows.  
- **Planned Application:** Will complement my SOC projects by solidifying **structured incident response knowledge** and prepare me for **CompTIA Security+**.  

---

## Whatâ€™s Next

My roadmap includes:  
- **CompTIA Security+** â€“ Core cybersecurity industry standard for threat detection, incident response, and system hardening.  
- **CompTIA Network+** â€“ Deepens networking fundamentals to support both IT troubleshooting and cybersecurity defense.  
- **(TBD Advanced Cert)** â€“ Iâ€™m evaluating a strong IT/cyber certification (e.g., Azure Security, CySA+, or Splunk) to complement my project work and career path.

## Takeaway

Each certification took **commitment and hours of study** â€” but the process was just as important as the credential. I learned how to:  
- Stay disciplined with structured, multi-week learning.  
- Translate cert content into **real projects** (SOC labs, recovery projects, AI builds).  
- Build a toolkit thatâ€™s both **recognized by industry** and **demonstrated in practice**.  

Certifications are stepping stones, not the end goal. For me, theyâ€™re a way to stay structured, motivated, and prepared for the next challenge in IT & cybersecurity.
